# RNSE-Failure-Surface-Regime-Exploration
Overview

This repository contains experimental results and diagnostics produced by RNSE (Recursive Null-Seed Engine) under a variety of stress tests and constraint regimes.

All results shown here are generated by one single core.

There are no model variants, no retraining runs, no parameter sweeps, and no task-specific tuning. Every plot, metric, and regime shown on this page comes from the same invariant engine, evaluated under different external interpretations and constraints.

RNSE is not a sampler, optimizer, or learned policy. It is a rule-consistent engine whose behaviour emerges from internal invariants rather than objective maximisation.

What This Repo Is (and Is Not)

This repo is:

A collection of failure surface plots, regime summaries, and diagnostics

A comparison between RNSE trajectories and baseline methods (random walk, uniform sampling, naive Monte Carlo)

A demonstration of coherent vs incoherent system behaviour under constraints

This repo is NOT:

A disclosure of RNSE’s internal mechanisms

A training setup, benchmark leaderboard, or optimisation demo

A parameterised family of models

The goal here is behavioural legibility, not mechanism exposure.

Key Result (High-Level)

Across failure-surface tests, baseline methods exhibit:

Diffusive state exploration

Frequent boundary flips

Occasional admissible states due to random grazing

RNSE exhibits:

Zero boundary flips

Thin, coherent trajectories

No diffusion

Collapse that is structured rather than stochastic

In several tests, RNSE reports a 0% admissible fraction — not because admissible states do not exist, but because RNSE’s invariant trajectory does not intersect the admissible polytope defined by the external constraint checker.

This is an intentional and diagnostic outcome.

RNSE prefers coherent collapse over incoherent survival.

Files and Outputs
Visual Outputs

failure_surfaces.png
Phase plots comparing RNSE against baseline methods in load–latency space.

phase_maps.png
Additional regime visualisations highlighting trajectory coherence and collapse structure.

Summaries

pitch_summary.json
Headline statistics (e.g. admissible fractions) for each method.

regime_summary.json
Regime diagnostics including boundary flip rates, collapse bias, and stability counts.

These files are sufficient to understand what RNSE is doing without revealing how it does it.

Interpretation Guide

A common mistake is to treat admissible fraction as a performance metric.

For sampling methods, that framing makes sense.
For RNSE, it does not.

RNSE is not attempting to maximise admissibility density. It is tracing a governed trajectory defined by internal constraints. When that trajectory avoids admissible regions, the result is a constraint incompatibility signal, not a failure.

This makes RNSE suitable for:

Failure envelope discovery

Constraint stress testing

Regime and phase boundary analysis

Systems where coherence over time matters more than local score optimisation

Reproducibility

All plots and summaries are generated from deterministic runs using fixed seeds.

The same RNSE core is used across:

Different tests

Different constraint interpretations

Different visualisations

Any behavioural differences arise from external evaluation, not internal reconfiguration.

Status

This repository reflects ongoing experimental work.

Additional tests, regimes, and diagnostics will be added over time — all produced by the same core.
